# MyTicketSeller

This project uses React and Redux to simulate a ticket selling or ticket vending environment in a movie theater. 

The user can select the seats they want by either pushing the button "Find Seats" and inputting the number of seats 
they would like to buy, or they can select the seats they want themselves. 

When they have seats selected, they can click on the "Buy Selected Seats" button which will turn the seats grey indicating they have been purchased. 
The user is thanked for his or her purchase, letting them know that they have "purchased" the tickets. 

The selections time out after ~30 seconds. 

The number of available (unselected and unpurchased) seats is displayed for the user's convenience. 

Selected seats are displayed in yellow, available seats in blue, and purchased seats in grey. 

Deselecting can be done by clicking the seats or by hitting the "deselect all" button.
